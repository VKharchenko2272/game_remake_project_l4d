                <h2>Welcome to the Dark Carnival Remake!</h2>
                <p>Dark Carnival has always been one of the standout maps in Left 4 Dead 2, known for its eerie
                    amusement park setting and intense gameplay moments. In this remake, I've taken great care to
                    enhance the map while preserving the elements that made it so memorable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Original Map Analysis</h2>
                <p>Dark Carnival is set in a sprawling amusement park filled with rides, games, and an ominous
                    atmosphere. Itâ€™s a map that combines open areas with claustrophobic interiors, creating a dynamic
                    and thrilling experience.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Remake Goals</h2>
                <p>My aim was to enhance the visual fidelity of Dark Carnival while keeping the iconic elements intact.
                    This means upgrading the textures to 4K, making the landscapes more realistic, and adding subtle
                    improvements that enhance the overall experience without deviating from the original charm.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p>Started with sketches and concept art to visualize the improvements. Early plans focused on key areas
                    that needed enhancement while maintaining the original layout.</p>
                <p>Detailed breakdown of the redesign process, including layout adjustments and new elements. This
                    involved refining the amusement park rides, updating the concert stage, and adding more detailed
                    environmental features.</p>
                <p>Upgraded all textures to 4K, ensuring high-quality visuals that enhance the realism of the map.
                    Improved lighting and shadows to create a more immersive atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Made minor gameplay adjustments to improve flow and balance. This includes refining enemy placements
                    and adding small features to enhance interactivity.</p>

                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>One of the major challenges was ensuring that the upgraded textures and realistic landscapes did not
                    detract from the original style. Balancing visual enhancements with the classic feel was crucial.
                </p>
                <p>To address this, I meticulously matched new textures to the original color palettes and styles. I
                    also focused on optimizing performance to ensure the map runs smoothly with the new enhancements.
